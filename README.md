# MaritimeApp

MaritimeApp is a modern web application built with **Vue 3**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, and **Vue Router**. It is designed for maritime operations such as clearing, forwarding, and managing clients, consignments, and company setups. Currently, a mock API is used via `json-server` for testing and development purposes.
